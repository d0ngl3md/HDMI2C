"""
The seesaw ecoders have some differences from the encoders used in V1 SketchyEtch:
first, i2c addresssing
second, memory, they can save the value of where they last were. ... for the entire time they are powered.
    removing the device from power, theyll forget thier position.
    but you can turn the knobs with this program off, and thyell keep storing positional data.
    which is really interesting.
    
might implement the buttons though I dont anticapte using them. 
There is also an RGB neopixel on each encoder.
